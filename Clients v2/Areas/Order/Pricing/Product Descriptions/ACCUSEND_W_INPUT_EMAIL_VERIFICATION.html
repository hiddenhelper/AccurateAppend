  Improve email deliverability and reduce bounces by identifying non-existent, invalid or expired email addresses with advanced verification technology.  It works by
  contacting the email host's server and determining whether the address is active and receiving mail.  If an email address is deemed to be undeliverable,
  we will attempt to add a verified deliverable address.
