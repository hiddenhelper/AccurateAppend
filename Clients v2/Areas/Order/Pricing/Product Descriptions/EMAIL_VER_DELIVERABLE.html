    Email verification will help determine the delivery status of your existing email addresses in real-time by pinging the hosted email server to verify whether the mailbox is active and receiving mail at that time.
</p>
<h4>How It Works</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Upload your file</li>
  <li>Our system will ping the hosted email server for each existing email addresses as well as scan for bots, spam traps, etc. Emails that successfully pass both steps receive a deliverable status.</li>
  <li>
    Each record should contain an email address. Records that do not contain an email address will be ignored.
  </li>
  <li>
    Output will contain delivery status of Deliverable, Undeliverable, or Unknown. You will not be billed for Unknown responses.
  </li>
</ul>
