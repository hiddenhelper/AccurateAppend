  Add email addresses to your customer, donor and prospect lists. Upload your file and we will search multiple data sources, match and append email addresses in as little as a few minutes.

<h4>How It Works</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Upload your file.</li>
  <li>Each record should contain name, address, city, and state. All other fields will pass through our system without being touched.</li>
  <li>Our system will match each record in your file against multiple data sources to locate the best email address.</li>
  <li>Before the output is returned, our system will verify each appended address with a real-time ISP ping to ensure the box is active.</li>
</ul>

            You are billed for matches only and the cost per match varies depending on the size of your file. When you upload your file, our system will analyze your file and present estimates based on historical system-wide match rates and the size of your file.

            Yes, if you select "verify existing email addresses" and "Append new verified email addresses", our system will verify your existing email address and append a tag to the end of the record with the verification status. If the email address can be verified then we won't attempt to append a new email address. If the existing email address is bad, then we'll attempt to append a new email address
